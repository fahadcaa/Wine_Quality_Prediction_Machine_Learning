Wine Quality Prediction - Machine Learning
This repository contains a Wine Quality Prediction project using Machine Learning. The goal is to build a predictive model that assesses the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties, such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH level.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Feature Selection: Identifying key attributes that influence wine quality.

Model Training: Implementing and comparing various ML algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.

Evaluation: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: (Optional) Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality Dataset, which consists of red and white wine samples with physicochemical properties and their corresponding quality scores (rated from 0 to 10).

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning)

Flask/Streamlit (if deployed)

ðŸ“Œ How to Use
Clone the repository

Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate models

(Optional) Deploy the model for real-world predictions
